# What is QSpace?

QSpace is an advanced open-source tensor library specifically designed to handle both Abelian and non-Abelian symmetries. Embedded in C++ and interfaced with Matlab, QSpace facilitates quantum symmetry spaces in tensor network states. Its capabilities allow users to exploit a variety of symmetries, including the U(1) and special unitary groups, making it versatile for different operations across symmetries. QSpace's design emphasizes a bottom-up approach, starting from the defining representation and utilizing Clebsch-Gordan coefficient tensors. This approach makes QSpace a powerful tool for developing tensor network algorithms, providing a user-friendly environment while handling complex symmetry details.

<h3>Open Source QSpace</h3>

The Open Source QSpace project includes a standard and a community edition. The community edition ([OSQSpace](https://github.com/Open-Source-QSpace/OSQSpace)) is a tailored version of the standard QSpace ([QSpace4u](https://bitbucket.org/qspace4u/)) tensor library which is part of our commitment to fostering an open, collaborative environment for scientific exploration and software development. The community edition is distinctively designed to cater to a vibrant community of developers, researchers, and academicians who are deeply invested in the advancement of tensor network algorithms for quantum lattice models.
