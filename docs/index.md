# What is QSpace?

QSpace is an advanced open-source tensor library specifically designed to handle both Abelian and non-Abelian symmetries. Embedded in C++ and interfaced with Matlab, QSpace facilitates quantum symmetry spaces in tensor network states. Its capabilities allow users to exploit a variety of symmetries, including the U(1) and special unitary groups, making it versatile for different operations across symmetries. QSpace's design emphasizes a bottom-up approach, starting from the defining representation and utilizing Clebsch-Gordan coefficient tensors. This approach makes QSpace a powerful tool for developing tensor network algorithms, providing a user-friendly environment while handling complex symmetry details.
