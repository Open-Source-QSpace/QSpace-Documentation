# Why Community Edition?

Welcome to the [Open Source QSpace - Community Edition]((https://github.com/Open-Source-QSpace/OSQSpace)), a tailored version of the standard QSpace tensor library which is part of our commitment to fostering an open, collaborative environment for scientific exploration and software development. The community edition is distinctively designed to cater to a vibrant community of developers, researchers, and academicians who are deeply invested in the advancement of tensor network algorithms for quantum lattice models.

### Advantages of the Community Edition

The community edition of QSpace stands out by emphasizing user collaboration and enhanced performance. Unlike the standard version of QSpace, which is open to the public for general usage under the Apache 2.0 license, the community edition is an exclusive offering that benefits from direct contributions from its users. This edition is ideally suited for those who are keen on diving deeper into both Abelian and non-Abelian symmetries, with a focus on participatory development and sharing of innovative ideas.

Our community-driven approach allows users to:

- **Collaborate directly with peers** and lead contributors such as Changkai Zhang and Dai-Wei Qu, who are both deeply involved in the ongoing development and maintenance of the library.

- **Access cutting-edge features and optimizations** before they become available in the standard release.

- **Contribute to the library's roadmap** by proposing new features, improving existing functionalities, and enhancing the libraryâ€™s documentation.

### Exclusive Community Access

Following the request of the original author, Dr. Andreas Weichselbaum, access to the QSpace community edition is exclusively available to members of the Open Source QSpace organization on GitHub. This ensures that contributions and enhancements are aligned with the high standards set for QSpace and that all modifications and expansions are thoroughly vetted by a community dedicated to excellence in quantum many-body research.

### Joining the Open Source QSpace Organization

Joining the Open Source QSpace organization is straightforward:

1. **Request an Invitation**: Interested parties are encouraged to request an invitation by contacting our current administrator [Changkai Zhang](https://www.theorie.physik.uni-muenchen.de/17ls_th_solidstate_en/members/sci_mem/anand1/index.html).
2. **Contribute**: Membership is granted primarily to those who are actively contributing to the project or who have a demonstrated interest in advancing tensor network algorithms and quantum symmetry spaces.

We welcome and value the unique perspectives and expertise each new member brings to QSpace. Together, we can propel the library to new heights, continuously adapting and refining it to meet the evolving challenges of quantum many-body physics and tensor network research. Join us in shaping the future of quantum many-body physics, one tensor at a time!
